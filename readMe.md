# SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Data Analysis

This repository contains a complete data analysis pipeline for the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch dataset, including data wrangling, exploratory analysis, SQL queries, predictive modeling, and a dashboard.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `01_data_wrangling.ipynb`: Clean and prepare the dataset
- `02_eda_analysis.ipynb`: Visualize trends and insights
- `03_sql_analysis.ipynb`: Run SQL-style queries on the data
- `04_predictive_modeling.ipynb`: Predict mission outcomes
- `05_folium_plotly_dashboard.ipynb`: Interactive map and charts
- `06_summary_report.ipynb`: Final conclusions and learnings
- `datasets/spacex_launch_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset

## 🧪 How to Run the Dashboard

Open `05_folium_plotly_dashboard.ipynb` and run all cells. It will generate:
